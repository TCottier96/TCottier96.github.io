### Flash-drag effect (FD)

**Explanation:** In this illusion, the two flashed lines are dragged in the direction of the grating's motion. The right grating is always moving in the opposite direction of the left grating, and the lines are always presented in vertical alignment. When the right grating is moving upwards, the left grating will be moving downwards, so you should perceive the right flash to be above the left flash. When the right grating is moving downwards, you would expect the opposite, so the right flash should be perceived below the left flash.

### Flash-grab effect (FG)

**Explanation:** In this example, an annulus rotates clockwise for 900ms, then reverses direction, rotating counterclockwise for 500ms. At the time of the reversal, a red circle is presented in the bottom centre of the circle for 16.67ms.

### Flash-lag effect (FLE)

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177491824-a72441c1-1d25-4e42-ba95-d4e67fe89cce.mp4" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177491824-a72441c1-1d25-4e42-ba95-d4e67fe89cce.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Explanation:** In this illusion there is a rod rotating clockwise. When the rod reaches zero degrees, a stationary flash is presented in spatio-temporal alignment with this moving rod. While the flash and rod are aligned, the rod is likely seen displaced in the direction of motion.

### Luminance flash-lag effect (Lum)

**Target's luminance is becoming darker** 
<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177512391-fd1c2dd0-d149-4ea4-9498-e5c3d5bc87ab.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Target's luminance is becoming brighter** 
<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177512597-2ff3ce9c-94a3-4ee4-af17-5c5dbc6791a2.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Explanation:** In this illusion, there is a target circle either above or below the fixation dot continuously changing in luminance (becoming brighter or darker). At a point in time, a circle with fixed luminance is flashed on the other side of the fixation dot. When the flash is presented, the flashed circle and target circle have the same luminance. Yet, the changing target circle will always be perceived in a luminance value further along it's luminance ramp. For example, if the target is becoming darker, at the time of the flash, it will be perceived as darker than the flash, even though their luminance is identical.

### Fröhlich effect (Froh)
<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177465611-de15d317-fde6-46b5-842a-4843b4bafdde.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Explanation:** In this example, the rod always starts in the centre of the screen, at zero degrees, pointing straight upwards. Because of motion, you may see the rods starting position on a rightward angle in the direction of motion (clockwise).

### Drifting Gabors (Gab)

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177280100-46042f52-c6b1-40af-9929-5747665dcbdc.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Explanation:** The top and bottom Gabors were always vertically aligned, but because motion is biasing the object's position, you may have seen the top gabors slightly closer to the edge of the screen than the bottom gabors. The Gabors  were always stationary, but their gratings were phase modulated. The bottom gabors always moved in the opposite direction of the top gabors. In this example, the top gabors are moving towards the edge of the screen, whereas the bottom gabors are moving towards the centre of the screen.

### Twinkle-goes illusion (TG)
**Static background noise**
<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63759578/177448995-037bc579-b22a-4bac-88c4-e91cf0ee53d3.mp4" autoplay loop='true' controls="controls" muted="muted" height="800" width="800">
</video>

**Dynamic background noise**

**Explanation:** In this illusion, the two squares always disappear when they are vertically aligned. When the background noise is static when the squares disappear, the squares final position should appear vertically aligned. When the background noise is dynamic, the squares final position should appear displaced in their direction of motion.
