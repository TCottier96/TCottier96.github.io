In this illusion, the two lines are dragged in the direction of the grating's motion. The right grating is always moving in the opposite direction of the left grating, and the lines are presented in vertical alignment. When the lines are first flashed, you should perceive the right flash to be dragged upwards above the left flash, as the right grating is going upwards. On the flashes second presentation, you should perceive the right flash to be dragged downwards, below the left flash.

The top and bottom Gabors were always vertically aligned, but because motion is biasing the object's position, you may have seen the top gabors slightly closer to the edge of the screen than the bottom gabors. The Gabors  were always stationary, but their gratings were phase modulated. The bottom gabors always moved in the opposite direction of the top gabors. In this example, the top gabors are moving towards the edge of the screen, whereas the bottom gabors are moving towards the centre of the screen.
